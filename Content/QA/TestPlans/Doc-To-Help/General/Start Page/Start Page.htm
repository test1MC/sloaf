        <p>Marcus: So I found where they are stored. Go to the AppData\Local\MadCap_Software\DocToHelp.exe_Strongname folder(there should be extra stuff at the end of the name). There are going to be folders there for all the versions of D2H you’ve run. Go to the folder for the last release(3.0.0.1217) and open the user.config file. There’s a “RecentFiles” xml attribute in the file. Clear out the value element and that should clear out your recent projects. This is not super convenient for the users so if we want to fix this for V4 we can(Robert add a bug for v4)</p>
