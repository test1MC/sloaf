                <p>Any notes you made on your module trello cards (troubleshooting tips, clarifications, known bugs, anything that would be useful for the qa tester next version) copy these notes into the corresponding Flare topic in the QA Test Plans project.  You can find where your topic is by looking at what label is on your card (ex: "General" means you should look in this path...QATestPlans\Content\QA\TestPlans\Doc-To-Help\General\ .... )</p>
