        <h3>UI </h3>
        <p>Lets you reverse or redo the most recent action(s) in a file. The undo and redo functions are enhanced in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">Unlimited:</span> You can undo or redo an unlimited number of times, back to the last time you opened the file, even after you have saved the document.</li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">Multiple buffers:</span> Each document in the interface has its own Undo/Redo buffer. This means that you can undo actions in one document and then switch to another document and undo actions specific to that file.</li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">User-friendly interface:</span> The name of the action is displayed on the Undo or Redo button. In addition, you can use the drop-down arrow next to the button to select multiple steps to undo or redo at once, even resizing the drop-down box as necessary.</li>
        </ul>
