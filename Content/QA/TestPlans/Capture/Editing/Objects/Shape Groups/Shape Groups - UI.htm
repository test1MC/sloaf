        <h2>Shape Groups - UI  </h2>
        <h5>General</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Shape group is a group of objects that have been "Stuck" together to essentially form one object</li>
            <li>
                <img src="../../../../../../Resources/Images/TestPlans/Capture/Capture-Groupicon.png" />Clicking the <span class="bold">Group Selected Items </span>toolbar item on the local frame toolbar, while you have multiple object selected, will group the selected objects into a shape group</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This toolbar item is disabled until multiple objects are selected</li>
                <li style="font-weight: normal;">Object is realizable by the 8 resize points around the object</li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">Right-Clicking</span> an object after making multiple selections and selecting <img src="../../../../../../Resources/Images/TestPlans/Capture/Capture-Groupicon.png" /> <span class="bold">Group Selected Items </span>will group the objects into a shape group</li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">Right-Clicking </span>a shape group object and selecting <span class="bold">Ungroup Shapes</span>, will remove the grouping          <ul><li>All objects within the group will still remain, maintaining all settings each object had prior to the grouping</li></ul></li>
            <li>Clicking and dragging the shape group will drag the shape group object to a new location</li>
            <li>All objects will maintain individual properties even while in a shape group, unless the shape group applies the same property<ul><li>For example:&#160;A rectangle object with a trajectory, will still follow its own trajectory UNLESS the shape group itself has a trajectory set</li></ul></li>
            <li>Holding Shift and grabbing corner handles rotates existing objects or groups at perfect angles based on 15 degrees<ul><li>Does not works initially when drawing (feature request in for that)</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
