        <h4>Verifying a successful import</h4>
        <p>After importing a DocToHelp project you should compare the Flare project to the original DocToHelp Project </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Compare the original project with the new one </li>
            <li>Compare the original output with the new projects output</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>
            <a name="DocToHel">
            </a>DocToHelp Features and Flare Equivalents</h4>
        <ul class="checkbox">
            <li>
                <span class="bold">Attributes/Conditions: </span>Doc-To-Help allows conditions on platforms (e.g., all Word targets). However, Flare does not support that feature; therefore conditions on platforms are not imported.</li>
            <li> <span class="bold">Glossaries: </span>Glossary terms will need to use style &lt;p class="GlossaryHeading"&gt; followed by a definition in a p tag (or multiple p tags) in order to be converted. If their definition contains a link to another term, we keep the text of that link.
</li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <span class="bold">Groups/Concepts: </span>Groups are similar to Flare's concepts, which can be used for a couple of things, including the creation of concept links (also called "See Also links" or "A-links"). When you import a Doc-To-Help project, groups are converted to concepts in a couple of different ways, depending on how they are created in Doc-To-Help:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>If you insert a group in Doc-To-Help by dragging the topic from the Topics pane to the Groups pane, Flare converts the group to a concept and adds it at the very top of the topic.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>If you insert a group in Doc-To-Help from the ribbon, you are adding it inline, as well as adding it to the Groups pane. Flare converts the group to a concept and adds it inline as well as at the very top of the topic. This means that when you have an A-link, that group might be listed twice in the output. Therefore, you may need to clean up your topics, removing the excess concepts.</p>
                        <p>If you already have a group link in Doc-To-Help, it is imported as a concept link in Flare.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">Keywords:</span> Keywords are similar to Flare's index keywords, which can be used for a couple of things, including the creation of keyword links (also called "K-links"). When you import a Doc-To-Help project, keywords are converted to index keywords in a couple of different ways, depending on how they are created in Doc-To-Help:<ul><li><p>If you insert a keyword in Doc-To-Help by dragging the topic from the Topics pane to the Index pane, Flare converts the keyword to an index keyword and adds it at the very top of the topic.</p></li><li><p>If you insert a keyword in Doc-To-Help from the ribbon, you are adding it inline, as well as adding it to the Index pane. Flare converts the keyword to an index keyword and adds it inline as well as at the very top of the topic. This means that when you have a K-link, that index keyword might be listed twice in the output. Therefore, you may need to clean up your topics, removing the excess index keywords.</p><p>If you already have an index link in Doc-To-Help, it is imported as a keyword link in Flare.</p></li></ul></li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">Plain Text Variables:</span>&#160;Flare does not support conditioned multiple variable definitions. Those definitions are imported as multiple variable definitions.</li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">Targets:</span> Flare does not import any target settings.</li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">Skins:</span> Flare does not import any theme settings to skins.</li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">TOCs:</span> If a TOC is not customized, it is not imported. An auto-generated TOC is not in the database when you import, so it is not considered customized. However, you can make a simple change in a TOC (e.g., move a TOC topic up and then down, not actually changing it). The TOC will then be considered customized and will import correctly.</li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">Topic Contents Widgets/Mini-TOC&#160;Proxies:</span> Although topic contents widgets in Doc-To-Help are similar to Flare's mini-TOC proxies, they are not identical. Therefore, you may see some discrepancies after the import conversion.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Background on word styles:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>If you author in Word using D2H, any new styles or modifications to styles are written to a template file (.DOT) which is stored in the User’s AppData folder.  If you convert (in D2H) your Word source files &gt; HTML5 source files, you won’t see the styles in the editor because editor styles are based on a separate folder of CSS files.  But when you build, D2H is smart enough to grab the information from the DOT files and convert them to CSS to maintain the right look in your output.  D2H stores these generated CSS files in the output subfolder LinksExt.  We will be asking users to save these generated CSS files and point to them during the Flare import.</li>
            <li>
                <p>The LinksExt folder might contain several stylesheets (separate ones for each topic) because each time a Word topic uses a style not already used in a previous topic, D2H creates a new stylesheet to account for the new style, and in the output will reference that (inline).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The Select CSS&#160;folder(s) for Word source documents... wizard page allows you to point to the LinksExt folder and all stylesheets will merge  into one CSS file.  D2H also generates their CSS files in ALL CAPS, so during the merge, those are changed to lowercase so that styles can be applied correctly.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
