        <p class="bold">Description:</p>
        <p>When you first start typing content, a popup may display below your text as you type. This is the Auto Suggestion feature, which analyzes text as you type and compares it to other content (e.g., phrases, variables, snippets) that already exists in the project. In addition to system content, text from your auto suggestions list, and variables, Flare recognizes when you are typing content that matches existing snippets in your project. This makes it a very fast and convenient way to single-source your content. You also have the ability to enable or disable the suggestions from particular files (i.e., those from a specific auto suggestions word list, those from specific variable sets), in case you want to use some types of suggestions but not others. You can also enable or disable suggestions from all snippets.Not only can you control which types of files are included in the Auto Suggestion popup, but you can also specify the maximum number of suggestions shown in the popup (from 1 to 25). In addition, you can specify the minimum number of characters that must be typed before the popup opens with suggestions (from 3 to 12).</p>
